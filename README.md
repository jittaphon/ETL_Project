# ETL Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building an **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipeline to manage the data processing workflow. The pipeline extracts data from various sources, transforms the data to fit operational needs, and loads it into a destination database for further analysis or reporting.

## Project Objectives
- Automate the extraction of raw data from multiple sources.
- Perform data transformations, including filtering, cleaning, aggregation, and calculations.
- Ensure efficient and accurate data loading into the destination database.
- Implement error handling, data validation, and logging for data quality and monitoring.

## Tools and Technologies
- **ETL Tool**: SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) Make Flow
- **SQL Tool**: SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) Write Query
- **Data Sources**: CSV, Excel, APIs
